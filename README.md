# Smart Fire Safety System

Third Year Project 

Grade recieved: 74%

Smart fire safety system is a simulation of a person exiting a building the safest possible way when a fire starts in a building.

Our system allows the user the option to either
1. Select a plan that is already created
2. Design their own floor and select where the person, the exit and the fire are located in the building.

Once this is created the user can select how many seconds they want the fire to be active for before the route is created.

This project utilizes: Python, A* search, Boundary fill algorithm and TkInter
